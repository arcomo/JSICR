  Abstract                 = {The level of research that e-voting has attracted is a testimony of its importance as a key element in the implementation of e-government. It is argued that the ease with which voting can be performed will increase participation and enhance accountability. This convenience however, generates a set of specific requirements, not least the ability of the underlying distributed system to model the behaviour of manual systems. More specifically, the elimination of direct physical intervention entails a careful management of the implications of virtual participation. The scope of this work concerns the identification and integration of specific mechanisms for addressing issues of security, privacy and accountability. The aim of this paper is to present a case study on the design and implementation of an e-voting prototype system, and to provide a context for the selection and deployment of relevant mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Establishing identity is becoming critical in our vastly interconnected society. Questions such as "Is she really who she claims to be?," "Is this person authorized to use this facility?," or "Is he in the watchlist posted by the government?" are routinely being posed in a variety of scenarios ranging from issuing a driver's license to gaining entry into a country. The need for reliable user authentication techniques has increased in the wake of heightened concerns about security and rapid advancements in networking, communication, and mobility. Biometrics, described as the science of recognizing an individual based on his or her physical or behavioral traits, is beginning to gain acceptance as a legitimate method for determining an individual's identity. Biometric systems have now been deployed in various commercial, civilian, and forensic applications as a means of establishing identity. In this paper, we provide an overview of biometrics and discuss some of the salient research issues that need to be addressed for making biometric technology an effective tool for providing information security. The primary contribution of this overview includes: 1) examining applications where biometric scan solve issues pertaining to information security; 2) enumerating the fundamental challenges encountered by biometric systems in real-world applications; and 3) discussing solutions to address the problems of scalability and security in large-scale authentication systems.},

  Abstract                 = {For many of us, the presidential election of 2000 was a wake-up call. The controversy following the vote count led to demands for election reform. But the new voting systems that were subsequently introduced to the market have serious security flaws, and many are confusing and difficult to use. Moreover, legislation has not kept up with the constantly evolving voting technology, leaving little to no legal recourse when votes are improperly counted. How did we come to acquire the complex technology we now depend on to count votes? Douglas Jones and Barbara Simons probe this question, along with public policy and regulatory issues raised by our voting technologies. Broken Ballots is a thorough and incisive analysis of the current voting climate that approaches American elections from technological, legal, and historical perspectives. The authors examine the ways in which Americans vote today, gauging how inaccurate, unreliable, and insecure our voting systems are. An important book for election administrators, political scientists, and students of government and technology policy, Broken Ballots is also a vital tool for any voting American.},

The method used to assess risk is not nearly as important as actually performing a structured threat risk modeling. Microsoft notes that the single most important factor in their security improvement program was the corporate adoption of threat risk modeling.
OWASP recommends Microsoft’s threat modeling process because it works well for addressing the unique challenges facing web application security and is simple to learn and adopt by designers, developers, code reviewers, and the quality assurance team.},

In this paper we illustrate the motivations behind the apparent failure of a process that, at a first sight, looks desirable for many reasons. We analyze the most relevant efforts in the field, which can be grouped in two main lines: those grounded on a strong formal foundation, and those designed to achieve maximum participation. From the analysis, we derive a set of desirable features, classify the systems according to their ability to achieve them, and conclude that no system is currently able to strike a convincingly positive balance between them.},

For example, optical scan and some cryptographically based voting systems are software independent. Variations and implications of this definition are explored. It is proposed that software-independent voting systems should be preferred, and software-dependent voting systems should be avoided.An initial version of this paper was prepared for use by the Technical Guidelines Development Committee in their development of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which will specify the requirements that the USA voting systems must meet to receive certification.},

  Abstract                 = {Remote voting through the Internet provides convenience and access to the electorate. At the same time, the security concerns facing any distributed application are magnified when the task is so crucial to democratic society. In addition, some of the electoral process loses transparency when it is encapsulated in information technology. In this paper, we examine the public record of three recent elections that used Internet voting. Our specific goal is to identify any potential flaws that security experts would recognize, but that may have not been identified in the rush to implement technology. To do this, we present a multiple exploratory case study, looking at elections conducted between 2006 and 2007 in Estonia, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. These elections were selected as particularly interesting and accessible, and each presents its own technical and security challenges. The electoral environment, technical design, and process for each election are described, including reconstruction of details which are implied but not specified within the source material. We found that all three elections warrant significant concern about voter security, verifiability, and transparency. Usability, our fourth area of focus, seems to have been well-addressed in these elections. While our analysis is based on public documents and previously published reports, therefore lacking access to any confidential materials held by electoral officials, this comparative analysis provides interesting insight and consistent questions across all these cases. Effective review of Internet voting requires an aggressive stance towards identifying potential security and operational flaws, and we encourage the use of third-party reviews with critical technology skills during design, programming, and voting to reduce the changes of failure or fraud that would undermine public confidence.},

  Abstract                 = {Emerging digital environments and infrastructures, such as distributed security services and distributed computing services, have generated new options of communication, information sharing, and resource utilization in past years. However, when distributed services are used, the question arises of to what extent we can trust service providers to not violate security requirements, whether in isolation or jointly. Answering this question is crucial for designing trustworthy distributed systems and selecting trustworthy service providers. This paper presents a novel trust measurement method for distributed systems, and makes use of propositional logic and probability theory. The results of the qualitative part include the specification of a formal trust language and the representation of its terms by means of propositional logic formulas. Based on these formulas, the quantitative part returns trust metrics for the determination of trustworthiness with which given distributed systems are assumed to fulfill a particular security requirement.},
